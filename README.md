# Virtual Magical Board
**Introduction**

The Virtual Magical Board is an AI-powered application that allows users to write mathematical equations in the air using their finger. The system detects the handwritten equation and solves it using Google's Gemini AI model.

**Features**

* Real-time hand tracking: Uses OpenCV and cvzone to detect hand gestures.

* Virtual Drawing Board: Draw mathematical expressions in the air.

* AI-powered Math Solver: Uses Google's Gemini AI to interpret and solve equations.

**Gesture Controls:**

* Index finger up: Draw on the canvas.

* Thumb and three fingers up: Send the equation to Gemini for solving.

* All fingers up: Clear the canvas.

**Technologies Used**

* Python

* OpenCV for video processing

* cvzone for hand tracking

* Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) for solving equations

* Streamlit for the web-based user interface

**Running the Application**

* Clone this repository or copy the script.

* Run the script using Streamlit:

* streamlit run math.py

* Allow camera access when prompted.

* Use the gestures mentioned above to interact with the board.
